**Main Project Goals**

  - Use professional programming techniques to solve data-modeling problems, write elegant JavaScript code, 
    and apply higher level concepts like object-oriented programming.
  - Keep track of the state of the game -- whose turn it is, where the X's and O's are on the board, 
    and whether the game is a draw or, if not, who won and lost.
  - Add programming to support playing against the computer
  - Use the module pattern to create game
